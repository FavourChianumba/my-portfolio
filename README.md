# three.js
# my-portfolio

The aim of the project is to create an introduction to my portfolio using three.js

â€‹
### Usage
firstly in your terminal you need to install three.js with:
npm install --save three
or install using a CDN, a link you would copy and paste in at the top of your javascript file (already in my code):
import * as THREE from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.126.1/build/three.module.js'

Next you will need to install Vite. This requires an NodeJS version of 12 or over, and will require you to have npm or yarn installed.
After these requirements are met installing Vite can be done through:
'install vite js' through google
or here are the actual commands:
1. Navigate from the home directory in your Terminal/Command Pormpt to the directory(folder) you want to create your project in 
2. $ npm init @vite/app or $ yarn create @vite/app 
3. name the project whatever you want, in this case for me 'my-portfolio
4. select vanilla template 
5 npm install
6. npm run dev

will need to run 'npm run dev' every time you want to run the vite app
